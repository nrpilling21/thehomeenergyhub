        Heat pumps typically cost between Â£8,000 and Â£15,000 installed for an air source unit, or
        Â£15,000 to Â£35,000 for ground source. With the Building Upgrade Scheme grant of Â£7,500 and the
        0% VAT rate valid until March 2027, the real cost for most households is substantially lower
        than these headline figures suggest.

      <Section title="Air Source Heat Pump Costs">
        <p>
          An air source heat pump sits outside your property and extracts heat from the ambient air,
          even in cold conditions. Installation typically costs between Â£8,000 and Â£15,000.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a straightforward 3â4 bedroom home with adequate space and reasonable access, expect to
          pay around Â£12,000 installed. This includes the unit, removal of your old boiler, pipework,
          wiring, commissioning, and a standard warranty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Costs push higher if you need new radiators or underfloor heating (adds Â£3,000âÂ£8,000),
          extensive pipework runs (Â£1,000âÂ£2,000), or if your existing heating system needs
          significant conversion work.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Ground Source Heat Pump Costs">
        <p>
          Ground source heat pumps are significantly more expensive because they require drilling
          boreholes or installing ground loops. Installation costs range from Â£15,000 to Â£35,000
          depending on ground conditions and property layout.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ground source systems are far more efficient than air source (COP of 4â5 vs 3â4), so they
          deliver greater energy savings over time. The main variable is geology: clay and chalk are
          cheaper to drill, while rocky ground significantly increases costs.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Running Costs: Heat Pumps vs Gas Boilers">
        <p>
          A modern heat pump costs roughly Â£800 to Â£1,200 per year to run, depending on your home's
          size, insulation, electricity tariff, and heating demand. A gas boiler costs approximately
          Â£1,000âÂ£1,400 per year, giving modest savings of 10â20% on fuel costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The comparison looks better when you factor in grants. After the Â£7,500 BUS grant, an air
          source heat pump costs roughly Â£1,500âÂ£2,500 net â often less than a new boiler
          installation.

      <Section title="The Building Upgrade Scheme (BUS) Grant">
        <p>
          The BUS offers Â£7,500 towards the cost of an air or ground source heat pump for UK
          homeowners. Most owner-occupied properties qualify. Your installer must be MCS-registered,
          and they typically handle the paperwork. Payment arrives 4â6 weeks after application.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scheme was extended until 2027, and 0% VAT on installations is confirmed until 31 March
          2027. After that date, VAT reverts to 20%, making installations noticeably more expensive.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Is a Heat Pump Worth the Cost?">
        <p>
          For most homeowners, yes â particularly when grants are available. After the Â£7,500 BUS
          grant and 0% VAT, air source installations often cost less than replacing a gas boiler.
          Payback periods are typically 8â12 years for air source, 12â18 for ground source.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your boiler is over 12 years old and you plan to stay in your home for the next decade,
          installing now is financially sensible. If your boiler is relatively new, waiting 2â3 years
          for further price reductions is reasonable.
